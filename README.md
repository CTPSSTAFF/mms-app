# mms-app
Monitored intersections CFML web app

This app was originally written by David Knudsen some time  before 2008, and rewritten by him circa 2015 in order to support screen readers. It was subsequently modified to read data from an PostgreSQL data source (rather than an Oracle data source) by Ben Krepp in the fall of 2017.

As it would be difficult (and enormously time consuming) to attempt to reconstruct the revision history of the first version, the code for the current working version of version 2 is being used to initialize this repo.
