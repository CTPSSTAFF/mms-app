# mms-app
Monitored intersections CFML web app

This app was originally written by David Knudsen some time  before 2008, and significantly rewritten by him circa 2015. It was subsequently modified to read data from an PostgreSQL data source (rather than an Oracle data source) by Ben Krepp in the fall of 2017.
